/* In this project we will calculate the correlatives of the subjects of a student.
    * The correlatives are the grades of the subjects that are related to the subject of the student.
    * In order to course a subject, you need to approve the correlatives that are related to the subject.
    * If you have approved all the correlatives, you can course the subject.
    * We are going to read a JSON file (materias.json) that contains the subjects and the correlatives. 
    * We will use the JSON.parse() method to convert the JSON string into a JavaScript object.
    * We will use the forEach() method to iterate through the object.
    * We will use the prompt() method to ask the user to enter the name of the subject.
    * We will use the if() statement to check if the subject is in the object.
    * If the subject is in the object, we will use the forEach() method to iterate through the correlatives.
    * We are going to create a new array that contains the correlatives of a subject. */
